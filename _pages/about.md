## Welcome

I started this site as a way to keep up my programming hobby, and I didn't know where it would go or what it would lead to.  I thought I might use it as you would a notebook sometimes - where I could grab stuff I needed of my phone. 

Its really just a place to post interesting stuff and always under construction.
Most everyone ends up here to see what the deal is with my E-Mail address - so hello to all you cyber stalkers out there!  I've had a lot of people come up at work and mention that they saw the site, and give me ideas and requests on stuff to post.

I started the whole thing over on the free servers at GitHub to keep myself challenged and learn version control, so it may be a little before you see all the other content I had up.

## Programming
I get a lot of questions about the best place to get started learning programming.  First and foremost, I would recommend learning Microsoft Excel.  Google Sheets is ok too, but sometimes there are formulas that don't work the same etc.  Once you have the hang of that, then try to get into coding. The important thing to do is figure out something that you like and start tracking it.  For the most part when you are at work, everything is protected so you can't mess with it, so you never get a chance to dig a little deeper.  A little joke we hear at work is that you see a lot of people that paid to get degrees, and all they do is use simple formulas in Excel and enter numbers all day.

When you feel good about formulas, move to making simple macros.  There are some really good websites and YouTube videos that have self paced walk-throughs.  The important thing is to make it work with something you have an interest in so that you keep hammering away at it.

When you start having to do repetitive tasks over and over, something at work that you have to change every day, then is the time to think about programming. I suggest starting with Python.

If you really want to get the ball rolling and delve into electronics and programming at the same time, buy and Arduino micro-controller.  They are super cheap, have thousands and thousands of tutorials, and provide a great place to learn electronics from the ground up.  This is a good stepping off point if you want to get into automation or learn a little about all that stuff going on under the hood of just about anything with a button on it.

### Collapsed Tubing Dimensions

When tubing collapses, sometimes you need a ballpark dimension to try and figure out what might be ‘looking up’ at you to pick the right grapple and overshot combination.  Just take the:

<pre>
(ID x Pi /2) + (OD-ID) 
2.441 * 3.1416 / 2 + (2.875-2.441) 
7.6686 / 2 + (.434) 
3.8343 + .434 = 4.27 Inches 
</pre>
A slightly more complicated way involves using the outside circumference:
<pre>
(((OD*Pi) – (OD-ID)*Pi  )/2 ) + (OD – ID)
((Circumference of Tubing – Circumference of Total Wall Thickness) / 2) + Wall Thickness
(((2.875 x 3.1416) – (2.875-2.441)*3.1416)/2) + (2.875-2.441)
(9.0321 – (.434*3.1416)) / 2) + .434
((9.0321 – 1.3635) / 2) + .434
(7.6686 / 2) + .434 = 4.27
</pre>


So… just over 4-1/4″

This is if the tubing hypothetically flattens absolutely flat, which is usually not the case.  The ends will likely be open a bit and bowed in lengthwise. This does help have a good estimate for selection of washpipe or other overshot / grapple tools needed to grab it.
